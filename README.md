# Fighting-Noise-with-Noise-in-Realistic-Quantum-Teleportation
A programme to check the results of Fighting-Noise-with-Noise-in-Realistic-Quantum-Teleportation by Raphael Fortes and Gustavo Rigolin
Requires the quantum package by José Luis Gómez-Muñoz and Francisco Delgado which can be found at http://homepage.cem.itesm.mx/lgomez/quantum/
I dont know how much of the code works since my computer kept on freezing.
